# information-gathering-challenge
The Information Gathering Challenge focuses on ethical reconnaissance by collecting public data about a target domain or IP using passive tools like WHOIS, DNS lookup, and Nmap, without any exploitation or unauthorized access

## Objective
The main goal is to identify and document essential details such as domain information, WHOIS data, DNS records, subdomains, open ports, technologies used, and public online presence without performing any exploitation or unauthorized access.

## Scope of Work
- Domain/IP analysis  
- WHOIS and hosting details  
- Subdomain enumeration  
- DNS record analysis (A, MX, NS, TXT)  
- Technology fingerprinting  
- Directory and file discovery  
- Open ports and services scanning  
- Email harvesting and public data research  

## Tools Used
- whois  
- nslookup / dig  
- nmap  
- whatweb  
- gobuster / dirsearch  
- theHarvester  
- amass / subfinder  
- Google Dorking  

## Methodology
The project follows a structured and ethical approach to reconnaissance by collecting only publicly available information. All activities are conducted using passive and legal techniques to understand the target’s infrastructure and technologies.

## Ethical Considerations
- No exploitation or unauthorized access  
- Only passive and legal information gathering  
- Respect ethical hacking guidelines and boundaries  

## Outcome
This challenge enhances practical reconnaissance skills and provides a strong foundation for later stages such as vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
